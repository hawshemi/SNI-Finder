# SNI Finder

This script will scan all domains with `TLS 1.3` and `h2` enabled on your VPS IP address range. These domains are useful for SNI domain names in various configurations and tests.

When you begin the scan, two files are created: `results.txt` contains the output log, while `domains.txt` only contains the domain names.

It is recommended to run this scanner locally _(with your residential internet)_. It may cause VPS to be flagged if you run a scanner in the cloud.


## Run

### Linux/Mac OS:

Be careful when choosing an architecture, all binaries are available in two versions - `amd64` and `arm64`.

1.
    ```
    wget "https://github.com/hawshemi/SNI-Finder/releases/latest/download/SNI-Finder-$(uname -s | tr A-Z a-z)-amd64" -O SNI-Finder && chmod +x SNI-Finder
    ```
2. 
    ```
    ./SNI-Finder -addr ip
    ```

### Windows:

1. Download from [Releases](https://github.com/hawshemi/SNI-Finder/releases/latest).
2. Open `CMD` or `Powershell` in the directory.
3.
    ```
    .\SNI-Finder-windows-amd64.exe -addr ip
    ```

#### Replace `ip` with your VPS IP Address.
