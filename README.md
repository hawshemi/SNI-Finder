# SNI Finder

This script will scan all domains that have `TLS 1.3` and `h2` enabled on your VPS IP address range. These domains are useful for SNI in a variety of configurations and tests.

When you begin the scan, two files are created: `results.txt` contains the output log, while `domains.txt` only contains the domain names.

It is Recommended to run this scanner locally _(with you residential internet)_. It may cause VPS to be flagged if you run scanner in the cloud.
